# Transaction Relay Service
This service allows us to have owners of the Safe contract that don’t need to hold any ETH on those owner addresses. How is this possible? The transaction relay service acts as a proxy, paying for the transaction fees and getting it back due to the transaction architecture we use.

Our target user hold crypto in a centralized exchange (or on another Ethereum address) and wants to move it to a secure account. We don’t want the user to trust us, for moving the funds and deploying the smart contract on their behalf. We on the other side want to prevent users from spamming our services, they shouldn't be a need to trust the user either.

That’s why we came up with this solution. The user (phone app) and us (service) both generate a random signature for a valid transaction. With this valid signed transaction, anyone can submit this to the blockchain and a Safe would be created with the following specifics:

- No one knows the private key, so no previous transaction can be sent before this tx. Any former transaction would invalidate the signure due to an invalid nonce.
- The Safe address can be derived, because it is calculated from the address of the sender (the address can be derived in turn from the signed tx, cf. [How is the address of an Ethereum contract computed?](https://Ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-Ethereum-contract-computed)).
- This transaction will create the Safe contract and refund the service with funds from within the Safe contract. Thereby the service has the guarantee that once it executes the tx, which incurres tx fees, it will get them back as part of the tx execution.

## API Endpoints
---
### /safes/ POST
Creates new Safe Creation Transaction with random signature, generated by user and server, so no one knows the private key of the deployer address.

**Note:** We don’t use a Chain ID to facilitate testing on different chains (cf. [EIP-155](https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs/issues/155). We don’t need the replay protection, because noone knows the private key. The PayingProxy is used in this process. Furthermore, we use "fast" from our gas station. The First version will only support ETH as gasToken. Therefore the payment will be returned in Wei.

More info about the signature values in appendix F of the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

#### Request:
```js
{
	"owners": ["<string>"], // Hexadecimal addresses, with checksum with 0x prefix,
	"threshold": "int", // min 1
	"s": "string", // stringified int, base 10,  (0 "< s "< secp256k1n / 2 + 1)
}
```

#### Returns 
> HTTP 201
```js
{
    "signature": {
        "r": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (0 "< r "< secp256k1n)
        "s": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (0 "< s "< secp256k1n / 2 + 1)
        "v": "<int>" // (27 or 28)
    },
    "tx" : {
        "from": "<string>",
        "value":  "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (wei) Will always be 0
        "data": "<string>",
        "gas": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10
        "gasPrice": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (wei)
        "nonce": 0
    },
    "Safe": "<string>" // hex string with checksum
    "payment": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10, it’s what the service gets as refund
}
```

> HTTP 400 not valid values submitted

**Note:** Atomic operation, many values of s are invalid which are generated by the server.

Clients should verify the server’s response with the following process:
1. Reconstruct sender address from `signature`
1. Reconstruct Safe address with sender address and `nonce = 0`
1. Verify that `Safe` checksum and reconstructed Safe addresses checksum are matching
1. Verify that `signature` is correct for hash of `tx`
1. Verify that `tx` has valid bytecode (postponed until mainnet release).
1. If all checks pass, then transaction and Safe address are valid and user can transfer at least `payment` amount of ETH to the Safe address.
1. Otherwise, the response has error or it is compromised, and it should not be used any further.

### /safes/\<address\>/funded/ PUT
Signal funds were transferred, start Safe creation

#### Returns:
> HTTP 202

**Note:** Creation has 2 txs and a check/. This is done asynchronously through a queue.

---
### /safes/\<address\>/funded/ GET
Get info about Safe's funding status

#### Returns:
> HTTP 200
```js
{
    "safeFunded": "<boolean>",  # Safe has enough balance to start the deploying
    "deployerFunded":  "<boolean>",  # Deployer was funded and confirmations awaited
    "deployerFundedTxHash": "<string>",  # Deployer funding tx hash
    "safeDeployed": "<boolean>",  # Safe was finally deployed
    "safeDeployedTxHash": "<string>"  # Safe tx was sent to the network
}
```

---
### /gas-station/ GET
Similar to ETH Gas Station but with reliable availability and sufficient rate limits
#### Returns:
> HTTP 200
```js
{
	"safeLow": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
	"standard": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
	"fast": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
	"fastest": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
}
```

---
### /safes/\<address\>/transactions/estimate/ POST 
Estimates the gas and gasPrice for the requested Safe transaction. Safe contract needs to exist previously. To estimate transaction cost, use the following formula:

> gasCosts = (safeTxGas + dataGas) * gasPrice
#### Request:
```js
{
	"to": "<address>",
	"value": "<string>", // stringified int, in wei
	"data": "<string>", // prefixed or unprefixed hex string
	"operation": "<integer>", // enumerated from here (0 - call, 1 - delegateCall, 2 - create)
}
```

#### Returns: 
> HTTP 200
```js
{
	"safeTxGas": "<integer>"
    "dataGas": "<integer>" 
    "gasPrice": "<integer>"
    "gasToken": "<string>" // hexadecimal address, checksumed, address(0) for now
}
```

---
### /safes/\<address>\/transactions/ POST
Allows to send and pay transactions via the Transaction Relay Service. The Safe contract the tx is directed to must have enough ETH to pay tx fees and be created through the tx relay service. Safe contract needs to exist previously.

#### Request:
```js
{
    "to": "<address>",
    "value": "<string>", // stringified int, in wei, base 10
    "data": "<string>", // prefixed or unprefixed hex string
    "operation": "<integer>", // enumerated from here
    "signatures": [{ 
        "v": "<integer>",
        "r": "<string>",
        "s": "<string>"
    }, ...], // Sorted lexicographically by owner address
    "safeTxGas": "<string>" // stringified int, base 10
    "dataGas": "<string>" // stringified int, base 10
    "gasPrice": "<string>" // stringified int, base 10
    "nonce": "<string>" // stringified int, base 10
    "gasToken": "<string>" // address
}
```

#### Returns:
> HTTP 201
```js
{
	"transactionHash": "<string>"
}
```

**Note:** Atomic operation.
