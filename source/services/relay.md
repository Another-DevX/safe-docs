# Transaction Relay Service
This service allows us to have owners of the Safe contract that don’t need to hold any ETH on those owner addresses. How is this possible? The transaction relay service acts as a proxy, paying for the transaction fees and getting it back due to the transaction architecture we use.

Our target user hold crypto in a centralized exchange (or on another Ethereum address) and wants to move it to a secure account. We don’t want the user to trust us, for moving the funds and deploying the smart contract on their behalf. We on the other side want to prevent users from spamming our services, there shouldn't be a need to trust the user either.

That’s why we came up with this solution. The user (phone app) and us (service) both generate a random signature for a valid transaction. With this valid signed transaction, anyone can submit this to the blockchain and a Safe would be created with the following specifics:

- No one knows the private key, so no previous transaction can be sent before this tx. Any former transaction would invalidate the signature due to an invalid nonce.
- The Safe address can be derived, because it is calculated from the address of the sender (the address can be derived in turn from the signed tx, cf. [How is the address of an Ethereum contract computed?](https://Ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/760/how-is-the-address-of-an-Ethereum-contract-computed)).
- This transaction will create the Safe contract and refund the service with funds from within the Safe contract. Thereby the service has the guarantee that once it executes the tx, which incurs tx fees, it will get them back as part of the tx execution.

## API Endpoints
---
### /safes/ POST
Creates new Safe Creation Transaction with random signature, generated by user and server, so no one knows the private key of the deployer address.

**Note:** We don’t use a Chain ID to facilitate testing on different chains (cf. [EIP-155](https://github.com/Ethereum/EIPs/issues/155). We don’t need the replay protection, because no one knows the private key. The PayingProxy is used in this process. Furthermore, we use "fast" from our gas station. The First version will only support ETH as gasToken. Therefore the payment will be returned in Wei.

More info about the signature values in appendix F of the [Ethereum Yellow Paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf).

#### Request:
```js
{
	"owners": ["<string>"], // Hexadecimal addresses, with checksum with 0x prefix,
	"threshold": "int", // min 1
	"s": "string", // stringified int, base 10,  (0 "< s "< secp256k1n / 2 + 1)
}
```

#### Returns 
> HTTP 201
```js
{
    "signature": {
        "r": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (0 "< r "< secp256k1n)
        "s": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (0 "< s "< secp256k1n / 2 + 1)
        "v": "<int>" // (27 or 28)
    },
    "tx" : {
        "from": "<string>",
        "value":  "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (wei) Will always be 0
        "data": "<string>",
        "gas": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10
        "gasPrice": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10 (wei)
        "nonce": 0
    },
    "safe": "<string>", // hex string with checksum
    "deployer": "<string>", // hex string with checksum,
    "funder": "<string>", // hex string with checksum
    "payment": "<string>", // stringified int, base 10, it’s what the service gets as refund
    "paymentToken": "<string>", // hex string with checksum
}
```

> HTTP 400 not valid values submitted

**Note:** Atomic operation, many values of s are invalid which are generated by the server.

Clients should verify the server’s response with the following process:
1. Verify that the `s` that you provided in the request matches the `s` returned in the response.
1. Verify that `tx.data` matches the bytecode of the Gnosis Safe Proxy contract with the correct owners and threshold. The `value` and `nonce` of the transaction should be zero.
1. Hash the transaction object (`tx`) and recover the account with the provided `signature`. The resulting address should match the `deployer`.
1. Compute the Safe address with the `deployer` address and `nonce=0`. The resulting address should match the provided `safe` address.

If all checks pass, then the transaction and Safe address are valid and the user can transfer at least the `payment` amount of ETH (if `paymentToken` is address `0x0`) or the corresponding amount of `paymentToken` tokens (if the `paymentToken` is a valid token address) to the Safe address. Please take a look at the [/tokens/](relay.html#tokens-get) endpoint to see which tokens are accepted for payment by our service.

Otherwise, the response has error or it is compromised, and it should not be used any further.

### /safes/\<address\>/funded/ PUT
Signal funds were transferred, start Safe creation

#### Returns:
> HTTP 202

**Note:** Creation has 2 txs and a check/. This is done asynchronously through a queue.

---
### /safes/\<address\>/funded/ GET
Get info about Safe's funding status

#### Returns:
> HTTP 200
```js
{
    "safeFunded": "<boolean>",  # Safe has enough balance to start the deploying
    "deployerFunded":  "<boolean>",  # Deployer was funded and confirmations awaited
    "deployerFundedTxHash": "<string>",  # Deployer funding tx hash
    "safeDeployed": "<boolean>",  # Safe was finally deployed
    "safeDeployedTxHash": "<string>"  # Safe tx was sent to the network
}
```

---
### /gas-station/ GET
Similar to ETH Gas Station but with reliable availability and sufficient rate limits
#### Returns:
> HTTP 200
```js
{
	"safeLow": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
	"standard": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
	"fast": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
	"fastest": "<string>", // stringified int, wei
}
```

---
### /safes/\<address\>/transactions/estimate/ POST 
Estimates the gas and gasPrice for the requested Safe transaction. Safe contract needs to exist previously. To estimate transaction cost, use the following formula:

> gasCosts = (safeTxGas + dataGas) * gasPrice
#### Request:
```js
{
	"to": "<address>",
	"value": "<string>", // stringified int, in wei
	"data": "<string>", // prefixed or not prefixed hex string
	"operation": "<integer>", // enumerated from here (0 - call, 1 - delegateCall, 2 - create)
    "nonce": "<integer>" // nonce of the last tx sent for execution
}
```

#### Returns: 
> HTTP 200
```js
{
	"safeTxGas": "<integer>"
    "dataGas": "<integer>" 
    "gasPrice": "<integer>"
    "gasToken": "<string>" // hexadecimal address, checksummed, address(0) for now
}
```

---
### /safes/\<address>\/transactions/ POST
Allows to send and pay transactions via the Transaction Relay Service. The Safe contract the tx is directed to must have enough ETH to pay tx fees and be created through the tx relay service. Safe contract needs to exist previously.

#### Request:
```js
{
    "to": "<address>",
    "value": "<string>", // stringified int, in wei, base 10
    "data": "<string>", // prefixed or not prefixed hex string
    "operation": "<integer>", // enumerated from here
    "signatures": [{ 
        "v": "<integer>",
        "r": "<string>",
        "s": "<string>"

## /tokens/ GET
Returns a paginated list of tokens. Each token has the ERC20 information (address, name, symbol, decimals) and if available additional meta information to the token (icon, website ...). Furthermore tokens can be marked to be shown to the user by `default`.

### Notes:
* Currently token info is retrieved from [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokens)

### Query params:
Besides pagination:
* `search`: Search words in `name`, `symbol` and `description`.
* `name`, `symbol` and `address`: Do an exact filtering based on that parameters.
* `default`: If `1` just show tokens marked to be shown by default.
* `gas`: If `1` just show tokens that can be used to pay for gas.
* `decimals__lt` and `decimals__gt`: Filter based on tokens with decimals _less than_ or _greater than_.

### Response
