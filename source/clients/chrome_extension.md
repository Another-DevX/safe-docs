# Chrome Extension (Safe Personal Edition)

## Download Mainnet Version

The Mainnet version of the Gnosis Safe browser extension can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store or from the GitHub releases page.

Note: The versions from GitHub and the Chrome Web Store are different, therefore it is not possible to update the Chrome Web Store version with a version downloaded from GitHub and vice-versa. Also the GitHub version will not receive automatic updates.
