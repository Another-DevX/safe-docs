# CLI

You can use the [safe-cli](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-cli/) to interact with your Safe using the command line. Its functionality is currently limited. We will be adding more in the future. Please open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-cli/issues/) for feature requests and bugs.
