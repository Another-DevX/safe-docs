[Universal Login](https://medium.com/universal-ethereum/universal-login-beta-3-gnosis-safe-support-more-9b72be0e01f8) enables full support for Gnosis Safe smart contracts. A newly deployed wallet is by default a Gnosis Safe. They leverage the Safe mainly due to its security: “Gnosis Safe is formally verified and audited code that is storing more and more value every month \(currently almost $9 million worth\)”

[Pepo](https://blog.gnosis.pm/network-effects-gnosis-safe-and-pepo-the-new-dapp-for-the-crypto-community-3b8160e62898), a video-sharing social network built on blockchain and developed by OST, utilized the Gnosis Safe smart contracts. For each new Pepo user, a new Gnosis Safe contract is deployed. The Pepo team decided to build on the Gnosis Safe stack because of its modularity, flexibility, and security, allowing their dapp to take advantage of session keys, multiple device management, and account recovery. A key contribution from Gnosis Safe to the dapp’s user experience is that its contracts enable users to have multiple devices.
